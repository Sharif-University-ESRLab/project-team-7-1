# Digital Logic Analyzer and Tester
## Project Description
In this project, we developed a digital logic analyzer and tester using an Arduino Mega board and python software. 
This system allows users to analyze up to 16 input signals in the graphic user interface, with features such as 
zooming in on and out of signals, saving and loading signals, and selecting which signals are shown. 
The tester module also allows users to generate two custom signals on the output pins of the device.
